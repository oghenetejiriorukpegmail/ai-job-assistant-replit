# Job Application SaaS Tool - Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for building the comprehensive SaaS tool for searching and applying for jobs.

## Phase 1: Core Setup & User Input

1.  **Project Structure:**
    *   Set up a monorepo or separate frontend/backend directories.
    *   Choose technology stack (e.g., Node.js/Express for backend, React/Vue/Svelte for frontend, Python for scraping/AI).
    *   Initialize basic project files (`package.json`, `.gitignore`, etc.).
    *   Set up database schema (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for users, resumes, jobs, applications.
2.  **User Authentication & Management:**
    *   Implement user registration and login (e.g., using JWT, OAuth).
    *   Create user profile pages.
    *   Set up user-specific storage directories/database structures.
3.  **Resume Upload & Parsing:**
    *   Implement file upload functionality for resumes (PDF, DOCX).
    *   Integrate a library or service to parse resume content (extract text, skills, experience, education).
    *   Store parsed resume data associated with the user.
4.  **Matching Preference Wizard:**
    *   Design and implement a simple wizard UI.
    *   Guide users to choose between:
        *   Matching based on the uploaded resume content.
        *   Matching based on a user-provided list of job titles.
    *   Store the user's preference.

## Phase 2: Job Search & Matching

1.  **Job Board Integration/Crawling Strategy:**
    *   Identify target job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, niche boards).
    *   Investigate APIs provided by job boards (preferred method).
    *   Develop web scraping scripts (if APIs are unavailable/insufficient), respecting `robots.txt` and terms of service. Use libraries like Puppeteer (Node.js) or Scrapy/BeautifulSoup (Python).
    *   Implement mechanisms for efficient and ethical crawling (rate limiting, user-agent rotation).
2.  **Job Data Storage:**
    *   Design database schema for storing job postings (title, company, description, location, URL, etc.).
    *   Implement logic to avoid duplicate job entries.
3.  **Matching Algorithm:**
    *   **Resume-based:** Develop an algorithm (e.g., using NLP techniques like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, or ML models) to compare parsed resume content with job descriptions.
    *   **Title-based:** Implement a simpler search based on the user's provided job titles.
    *   Develop a scoring system to rank job matches.
    *   Display matched jobs to the user.

## Phase 3: Document Generation & Management

1.  **Resume Template Engine:**
    *   Create base resume templates.
    *   Develop logic to dynamically populate templates with user data and tailor content based on the specific job description (highlighting relevant skills/experience).
2.  **Cover Letter Template Engine:**
    *   Create base cover letter templates.
    *   Develop logic to generate cover letters, referencing the company name, job title, and key requirements from the job description.
3.  **AI Integration (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to enhance resume and cover letter tailoring, making them more natural and specific to each application.
4.  **Document Storage:**
    *   Implement secure storage for generated documents (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local filesystem if scaled appropriately).
    *   Organize storage by user and then by application/company name.
    *   Store metadata about generated documents (associated job, date created) in the database.
5.  **Download Functionality:**
    *   Implement endpoints/UI elements for users to download their generated resumes and cover letters (likely in PDF format).
    *   Ensure filenames include the company name (e.g., `Resume_CompanyName.pdf`).

## Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling

1.  **Infrastructure Setup:**
    *   Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) or hosting solution.
    *   Set up necessary services (servers, database, storage, potentially task queues for scraping/generation).
2.  **Deployment Strategy:**
    *   Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
    *   Configure environment variables for different stages (development, staging, production).
3.  **Monitoring & Maintenance:**
    *   Set up logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, Prometheus/Grafana).
    *   Plan for regular updates, backups, and security patches.

## Next Steps

*   Commit this plan to the local Git repository.
*   Begin implementing Phase 1, starting with the project structure and technology stack selection.
